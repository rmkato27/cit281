# cit281

p1: gain experience using VScode by using commands to create folders and files, as well as create a basic math function.

p2:This project involves refactoring and version controlling JavaScript code by isolating it into functions, eliminating global variables, and using meaningful variable and function names. The process includes creating a Git repository, converting functions to function expressions, and using VSCode for git operations and ignoring files with a .gitignore file.

p3:This project involves creating a web application that manages coin denominations and calculates their total value. The application is structured around a Node.js environment using Fastify for the backend server.

p4:This project involves setting up a Node.js application using Fastify to manage and serve a Q&A (questions and answers) functionality. It includes creating data files, server setup, and a series of APIs to handle questions and answers, with capabilities for CRUD operationsâ€”create, read, update, and delete.

p5:This project involves developing a game in JavaScript where monsters with defined lifespans and abilities drain life over time, using classes to manage game mechanics and async functions to handle game timing, demonstrating object-oriented programming and asynchronous JavaScript.

p6:The project focuses on implementing geometric shape classes in JavaScript, including Shape, Rectangle, and Triangle, each with methods to calculate perimeter and area, and utilizing modern JavaScript features like class inheritance, the reduce method, and Heron's formula for area calculation.

p7:The project encompasses setting up a main GitHub Page and individual repositories for each lab and project from a programming course, detailing each with descriptions and learning outcomes, and enhancing accessibility and presentation through consistent theming and detailed documentation.

lab-01: install and setup vscode, practice software tools, keyboard shortcuts, practice using the terminal in vscode, and practice using node.js.

lab-02:using the vscode terminal to create a github repo, as well as adding files, ignoring files, and viewing how it interacts with github in the browser.

lab-03:This lab focuses on enhancing JavaScript skills by practicing modern syntax such as refactoring, destructuring, converting functions to arrow functions, utilizing for..in and for..of loops, creating and importing Node.js modules, and using the spread operator.

lab-04:This lab involves setting up a Fastify Node.js web server, initializing it with npm, adding Fastify, managing the project with git including handling node_modules, fixing MIME issues, and adding a second route with query parameters for testing and committing changes.

lab-05:This lab involves downloading and installing Postman, creating a CIT 281 collection, setting up a Node.js and Fastify server to handle GET and POST requests with JSON responses, and using Postman to test these functionalities, with deliverables to be submitted with Project 4.

lab-06:This lab involves joining GitHub and completing an introductory course, creating lab files, reviewing classes, and creating and testing Book and Library classes with functionalities to add books, assign ISBNs, and implement deletion methods.

lab-07:This lab involves creating a personal GitHub website, setting up a GitHub repository, cloning it locally, initializing and updating a JavaScript file with Node.js to practice error handling, and pushing changes back to GitHub.

lab-08:This lab involves creating a lab file, initializing a Node.js folder, installing the node-fetch package, adding Fastify starter code, and fetching data from JSONPlaceholder.

lab-09:This lab involves creating a Learning Lab course within your GitHub account, practicing navigation within the course, completing the course, and downloading the completed course repository as a deliverable.
